\abstract{The patch generated by automatic program repair (APR) needs to be verified. APR usually uses the test suite as the criterion for verifying the correctness of the patch. However, the test suite is unable to fully represent the oracle of the program, which causes APR to generat a large number of overfitting patches that not only fail to fix the original error, but also cause new errors. In order to reduce the number of overfitting patches generated by APR, this paper proposes an overfitting patches identification method for APR, PatchID. The core idea of PatchID is that the dynamic behavior of the passing tests between the buggy program and the correct patch is the same, however the dynamic behavior of the failing tests between themis different. The algorithm first constructs the dynamic behavior expressions that cause the bug from the program and the test suite, then generates new tests to enhance the original test suite, and finally gets the same dynamic behavior expressions from the patch, and identifies whether the patch is overfitting according to whether the value of the dynamic behavior expression changes with the use of the patch. The paper is evaluated on two datasets consisting of 157 Defects4J patches and 380 Java + JML patches, respectively. PatchID successfully identifies 63 overfitting patches and 15 correct patches on the first dataset, and 169 overfitting patches on the second dataset. In addition, PatchID classifies overfitting patches into three types of patches. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper is superior to the existing similar methods.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

Automatic program repair (APR) has been widely studied in the past decade, and a large number of repair technologies have been proposed. Especially after the emergence of GenProg[1], the APR based on test suite occupies the vast majority. The test suite based APR takes a given test suite as oracle and generates patches that are considered correct if they passes the test suite. Accurally, the test suite is weak and can not fully represent the oracle of the program, which results in the existence of patches that pass all the tests but are still wrong, that is, overfitting patches. As a result, APR technology produces a large number of invalid patches. Current APR technologies are far from mature, and most of them will simply accept patches that pass the test suite. According to [5], the majority of patches generated by GenProg, AE  and RSRepair are incorrect. More recent techniques try to find many other strategies (e.g., using human-written patches, repair templates and condition synthesis, bug-fixing instances  and forbidden modifications) for repair. However their  repair performance is still lower.

Due to the low performance of current APR techniques,  software developers have to verify a large amount of patches manually to filter out overfitting patches, which consumes too many resources.  Therefore, it has become an urgent problem to identify overfitting patches. If a patch passes the test suite and is considered the correct patch, then simply enhancing the test suite can reduce the number of overfitting patches. However, automatic test generation tools can only generate test inputs, and the appropriate test outputs still need to be determined manually. Even so, these approaches still fail to express a complete oracle. It is very difficult to have a complete oracle for a program, especially for large projects. Nilizadeh[7] used a formal method (specification and verification), JML as correctness criterion to successfully describe a small  project. However facing the large project, such as Defects4J[48], JML fails. And it seems impossible to use JML to describe such a large project.

At present, it is already very helpful to identify whether a patch is overfitting or not because quickly identifying overfitting patches can improve the success rate  of APR technology. Furthermore, if there is technology to subdivide overfitting patches, it can speed bugs fixing. According to reference [4], overfitting patches can be divided into the following three categories:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\bullet$]A-Overfitting Patch: The patch does not completely fix the incorrect behavior nor does it destroy the original correct behavior.
	\item[$\bullet$]B-Overfitting Patch: The patch that fixes the original incorrect behavior but destroys the original correct behavior, which is also called regression.
	\item[$\bullet$]AB-Overfitting Patch: The patch destroys the original correct behavior instead of fixing the incorrect behavior.
\end{itemize}

Because the test suite is not complete, it is far from sufficient to  use the consistency of the actual output of the program and the test output, that is to say, the current APR technology does not take full advantage of the test suite, only uses the input and the output of the test suite, and does not dig into the hidden information in the test suite. At present, different overfitting identification methods have been proposed. Among them, the strategy proposed by Xiong [8] is the first technology to mine the deep behavior of test suites and programs. Through the ideas of TEST-SIM and PATCH-SIM, the identification rate of overfitting patch can reach 56%. The experiment of Yang [6] shows that patches can modify the behavior of the program. They try to use program invariants to describe the program behavior and observe the program oracle from another view. Inspired by this, we propose a new technique, PatchID, to solve the problem of patch overfitting.

The goal of PatchID is to determine the category of a patch by digging into the correct behavior of the program based on a given test suite. While patches are able to pass the test suite, the passing tests reflect the correct behavior of the program, and the failing test reflect the wrong behavior of the program. From this point of view, patches should maintain the correct behavior of the program and modify the wrong behavior of the program. We believe that there are specific relationships between variables in a correct program, which are reflected by their values at runtime, and these relationships are a manifestation of the correct behavior of the program. So PatchID identifies a patch based on the following two important observations, which are from the perspective of program runtime variables:


To sum up, the contributions of this paper are:

•	5-tuple for computing program execution similarity is proposed.
•	An overfitting patch identification and subdivision algorithm is designed for automatic patch generation.
•	The framework of overfitting patch identification is implemented and the proposed method is evaluated. The results show that the proposed method is effective.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 begins with a discussion of related work. Section 3 describes some of the necessary concepts involved in the approach of this paper. Section 4 describes the method in this paper in detail. Section 5 presents an experimental evaluation of the method presented in this paper. Finally, the paper is summarized in Section 6.

\section{Equations}\label{sec4}

Equations in \LaTeX\ can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (``display equations''). For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. E.g.: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command \verb+$H \psi = E \psi$+.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or align environments:
\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively (refer Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec2}).

\section{Tables}\label{sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables you should use \verb+\footnotetext[]{...}+ tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). 
For the corresponding footnotemark use \verb+\footnotemark[...]+

\begin{table}[h]

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table}+ environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable*}+.

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX\ compilation and \verb+pdf/jpg/png+ images for \verb+PDFLaTeX+ compilation. This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+ can be generalized. The package used to insert images in \verb+LaTeX/PDFLaTeX+ is the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

%%=============================================%%

%% \bigskip command. please ignore this.       %%
%%=============================================%%
\bigskip
\begin{verbatim}

\caption{This is a widefig. This is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption  this is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption}\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide \verb+\begin{figure*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{figure*}+.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \verb+\includegraphics+ tag. Please ignore this. 

\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}

Packages \verb+algorithm+, \verb+algorithmicx+ and \verb+algpseudocode+ are used for setting algorithms in \LaTeX\ using the format:

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting \verb+algorithm+ environment. For program codes, the ``program'' package is required and the command to be used is \verb+\begin{program}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{program}+. A fast exponentiation procedure:

\begin{program}
\BEGIN \\ %
  \FOR i:=1 \TO 10 \STEP 1 \DO
     |expt|(2,i); \\ |newline|() \OD %
\rcomment{Comments will be set flush to the right margin}
\WHERE
\PROC |expt|(x,n) \BODY
          z:=1;
          \DO \IF n=0 \THEN \EXIT \FI;
             \DO \IF |odd|(n) \THEN \EXIT \FI;
\COMMENT{This is a comment statement};
                n:=n/2; x:=x*x \OD;
             \{ n>0 \};
             n:=n-1; z:=z*x \OD;
          |print|(z) \ENDPROC
\END
\end{program}


\begin{algorithm}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$ 
\State $y \Leftarrow 1$
\If{$n < 0$}\label{algln2}
        \State $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow -n$
\Else
        \State $X \Leftarrow x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow n$
\EndIf
\While{$N \neq 0$}
        \If{$N$ is even}
            \State $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \Else[$N$ is odd]
            \State $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N - 1$
        \EndIf
\EndWhile

Similarly, for \verb+listings+, use the \verb+listings+ package. \verb+\begin{lstlisting}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{lstlisting}+ is used to set environments similar to \verb+verbatim+ environment. Refer to the \verb+lstlisting+ package documentation for more details.

\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command. You can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure~\ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command 
\verb+Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure~\ref{fig1}''. 

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm~\ref{algo1} is \verb+\label{algln2}+. To cross-reference it, use the command \verb+\ref{algln2}+ for which it comes up as line~\ref{algln2} of Algorithm~\ref{algo1}.

\subsection{Details on reference citations}\label{subsec7}

Standard \LaTeX\ permits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template uses \verb+natbib+ \LaTeX\ package. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.

Here is an example for \verb+\cite{...}+: \cite{bib1}. Another example for \verb+\citep{...}+: \citep{bib2}. For author-year citation mode, \verb+\cite{...}+ prints Jones et al. (1990) and \verb+\citep{...}+ prints (Jones et al., 1990).

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article: \cite{bib3}, \cite{bib4}, \cite{bib1}, \cite{bib6}, \cite{bib7}, \cite{bib8}, \cite{bib9}, \cite{bib10}, \cite{bib11} and \cite{bib12}.

\section{Examples for theorem like environments}\label{sec10}

For theorem like environments, we require \verb+amsthm+ package. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists---\verb+thmstyleone+, \verb+thmstyletwo+ and \verb+thmstylethree+

\section{Methods}\label{sec11}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work. Authors are encouraged to include RIIDs where appropriate. 

\textbf{Ethical approval declarations} (only required where applicable) Any article reporting experiment/s carried out on (i)~live vertebrate (or higher invertebrates), (ii)~humans or (iii)~human samples must include an unambiguous statement within the methods section that meets the following requirements: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Approval: a statement which confirms that all experimental protocols were approved by a named institutional and/or licensing committee. Please identify the approving body in the methods section

\item Accordance: a statement explicitly saying that the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations

\item Informed consent (for experiments involving humans or human tissue samples): include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardian/s
\end{enumerate}

If your manuscript includes potentially identifying patient/participant information, or if it describes human transplantation research, or if it reports results of a clinical trial then  additional information will be required. Please visit (\url{https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies}) for Nature Portfolio journals, (\url{https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/publishing-ethics/14214}) for Springer Nature journals, or (\url{https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies\#ethics+and+consent}) for BMC.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
