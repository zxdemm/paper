This repaired program is correct if we use it by running the "menu()" method. However, the "withdraw()" method has protected visibility and can be called by a tester, and this method is still buggy. Thus, the program is not correct. If the "withdraw()" method was private (as this method was only accessible from the "menu()" method), we would consider it as a correct program, but the visibility is not private.
